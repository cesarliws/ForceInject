# ðŸ“± forceinject_flutter

Flutter integration helpers for [ForceInject](https://pub.dev/packages/force_inject) â€” a lightweight, zero-runtime-dependency DI container inspired by .NET Core.

## Features

- `ForceScopeWidget` to manage `ServiceScope` lifetimes automatically
- `ForceViewModelBuilder<T>` for DI + reactive UIs
- Built to work with Flutter idioms like `ValueNotifier`, `StatefulWidget`, etc.

## Status

Early stage â€“ usable, but evolving. Feedback welcome!
